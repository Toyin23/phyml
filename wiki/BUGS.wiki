  * _03 Feb 2010._ Bug found in *bootstrap calculation*. The comparison of bipartition of equal size could fail when the first character of taxon names were identical. I expect the impact of this bug to be minor.

  * _03 Feb 2010._ The calculation of *unconstrained likelihood* values ignore gap and indels. It is not a bug but a more sophisticated treatment of those characters would be more appropriate.
