  * _19 September 2011._ Versions prior to phyml-20110919.tar.gz have an important bug affecting PhyTime. Priors on node ages are not recorded properly (except for the root node). Analysis conducted with versions of PhyML older that this one need to be re-run. Sorry for the inconvenience.

  * _04 March 2011._ Due to a bug introduced in revision 568 (commited the 3rd of Nov. 2010), the bootstrap analysis would not complete. It has been fixed in revision 596.

  * _03 Feb 2010._ Bug found in *bootstrap calculation*. The comparison of bipartition of equal size could fail when the first character of taxon names were identical. I expect the impact of this bug to be minor.

  * _03 Feb 2010._ The calculation of *unconstrained likelihood* values ignore gap and indels. It is not a bug but a more sophisticated treatment of those characters would be more appropriate.

  * _14 Sep 2010._ The calculation of *bootstrap values with the MPI version of PhyML development version* is flawed. This bug is expected to have been introduced in the program early in 2010. It does not affect the non-development version of PhyML nor the binaries available on http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr.
